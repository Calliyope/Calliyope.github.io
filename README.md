This project aimed to introduce HTML and CSS to beginning web developers. We were instructed to create a site with at least 2 pages that was correctly structured and based on ourselves. While hideous in appearance, I believe I have pretty much nailed this task.  

This repository was made to share my learning with my peers and coaches at BeCode.
